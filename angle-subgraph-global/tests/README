# Run tests
Run `yarn test <DataSource Name>`
ex: yarn test StableMasterTemplate

Don't forget to always rebuild before:
yarn graph build && yarn test StableMasterTemplate

If you want a full trace, in case of error (even though errors are not really useful with Matchstick): 
yarn graph build && RUST_BACKTRACE=full yarn test StableMasterTemplate

IMPORTANT !!
Always include the test file in the mapping file, like that:
export { runTests } from "../tests/angle.test";

But this is useful only to run tests.
Before deploy, remember to remove that line
